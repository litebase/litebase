# Contributing to Litebase

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Litebase. We welcome contributions from the community.

## Issues

Issues are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the documentation content, or something about the docs.github.com website, that should be updated, search the open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a template. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you'd like to be fixed.
